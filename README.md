# "*Software Development*"

Please feel free to describe the essential Software development principles and patterns. [Here](TASK.md) you will find guidance.  
*"Do. Or do not. There is no try."* [1]

## Design-Patterns
* [Strategy](design-patterns/strategy/README.md)
* [Observer](design-patterns/observer/README.md)
* [Decorator](design-patterns/decorator/README.md)
* [Simple Factory](design-patterns/simpleFactory/README.md)
* [Factory Method](design-patterns/factoryMethod/README.md)
* [Abstract-Factory](design-patterns/abstractfactory/README.md)
### Prinzipien
* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interfaces, not implementations
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
* Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
* Depend in abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes
